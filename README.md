A React-based truck optimization application that helps with logistics and route planning.

## 🚀 Live Demo

Deploy this app to Vercel by connecting your GitHub repository.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- React 19.1.1
- Bootstrap 5.3.8
- React Bootstrap 2.10.10

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jeetshorey123/logistic.git
cd logistic
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

The app will open at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 🏗️ Build

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build folder will contain the optimized production files.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
3. Vercel will automatically detect this as a React app and deploy it

The project includes a `vercel.json` configuration file for optimal deployment.

### Manual Deployment

You can also deploy the build folder to any static hosting service.

## 📝 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
